# SlipringPCB

This is a PCB used to provide hotswapping capabilities when used with a slipring. A slipring allows unrestricted movement on a rotating gimbal. Here, a PCB is used to gather all signal and power lines as one giant plug that snap-in to a header, which is then distributed to their respective electronics.<br>
<br>
**This PCB is made for a 24V, 10A system**, excluding communication, which functions at a much lower voltage (~5V)<br>
<br>
Part Specifications:<br>
1 x 13Pin Phoenix Contact Connector + Header<br>
1 x M8 Angled Aviation Plug (DC,CAN-H,CAN-L,GND)<br>
1 x 4PIN JST-GH (5V PIN is unused)(UART)<br>
1 x 2PIN JST-GH (CAN BUS)<br>
2 x XT30PW-M<br>
